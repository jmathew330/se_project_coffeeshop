## Plan on improving the project

Add an animation to the header's text - "Specialty coffee" and "in the Triple Peaks Library" so that it displays a "fade-in" transition from the bottom when a user first visits the website. Many websites are adopting this modern concept for text elements and I believe it would enchance the aesthetic of the webpage.
